# C Fluid-Sim

> “Look, anything you do, if it isn’t hard, it isn’t doing anything for you. So you’re better off not doing it. Use your time somewhere else.”

A particle-based fluid simulation implemented in C using the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) graphics library for visualization.

The simulation is based on the particle-based fluids methods described in [Müller et al., 2013](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf).
